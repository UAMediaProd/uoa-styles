Developing a style guide for UoA online courses.

## How to use and edit

1. Clone this repository
2. [Install NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if not already installed
3. Using Command Line or Terminal, navigate to the cloned folder
4. Inside your terminal, run `npm install` or `npm i` to install any dependencies
5. Then type ```npm start``` to get things up and running locally. This will spool up a local server running the site at http://localhost:8080/uoa-styles/
6. Make any changes inside the `src` folder items and review the changes on the local server
7. Push through changes when you're happy with them; `npm start` auto-builds changes ready for deployment.
